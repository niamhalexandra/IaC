# Infrastructure as Code

*Infrastructure as Code (IaC) refers to the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools*

### When to Use IaC:

1. *Automation*: Use IaC when you need to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure resources.
2. *Consistency*: Employ IaC to ensure consistency in infrastructure configurations across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
3. *Scalability*: Use IaC to easily scale infrastructure resources up or down based on demand.
4. *Collaboration*: IaC can facilitate collaboration among development, operations, and security teams by maintaining infrastructure configurations as code.

### Why Use IaC:

1. IaC allows you to recreate entire environments reliably and consistently, reducing the risk of configuration errors.
2. By automating infrastructure provisioning and management, IaC reduces manual effort, speeds up deployment processes, and minimizes the likelihood of human error.
3. Infrastructure configurations stored as code can be versioned and tracked using version control systems like Git, enabling better change management and auditability.
4. With IaC, you can easily modify, update, or rollback infrastructure configurations by making changes to the codebase, providing greater agility and adaptability to evolving requirements.
5. IaC allows you to optimize resource usage and minimize costs by dynamically provisioning and deprovisioning infrastructure resources based on workload demands.

### Where would you use IaC?

1. Provisioning Environments: Setting up development, testing, staging, and production environments consistently and efficiently.
2. Configuration Management: Ensuring that server configurations are consistent across the infrastructure.
3. Scaling Infrastructure: Automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand.
4. Disaster Recovery: Quickly rebuilding infrastructure in case of failures or disasters.
5. Compliance and Security: Enforcing security policies and compliance standards across the infrastructure.

### What tools are out there for IaC?

* Terraform: A widely-used tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure.

* Ansible: An open-source automation tool that focuses on configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It's agentless and uses SSH to connect to servers, making it easy to set up and use.

* Chef: A powerful automation platform that uses a declarative approach to infrastructure configuration. It allows for the creation of reusable configuration "recipes" and "cookbooks."

* Puppet: Another configuration management tool that provides a model-driven approach to automate the delivery and operation of infrastructure and applications.

* AWS CloudFormation: A service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for provisioning and managing AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.

### Ansible

Good for:
* Configuration management
* Application deployment
* Provisioning infrastructure
* Orchestration of complex workflows

#### Main advantages:

1. Agentless: Ansible does not require any agents to be installed on managed hosts, reducing overhead and simplifying management.

2. Simple Syntax: Ansible playbooks use YAML, which is easy to read and write, making it accessible to both developers and sysadmins.

3. Versatility: Ansible can manage diverse infrastructure components, including servers, networking devices, and cloud services.

4. Community and Ecosystem: Ansible has a large and active community, with extensive documentation, modules, and roles available.

5. Idempotent Operations: Ansible ensures that running a playbook multiple times produces the same result, making it safe for automation.
